                    <article class="about-content">
                        <p>
                            My professional background is rooted in engineering discipline and safety-critical systems. 
                            With a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering, 
                            I have developed automotive software for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) during the past four 
                            and a half years, contributing to projects for major manufacturers, including Volkswagen. My work has primarily 
                            focused on functional safety–oriented development, where precision, traceability, and reliability are not optional.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Working in safety-critical environments has shaped how I approach software: structured architecture, 
                            defensive programming, and a strong awareness of edge cases. I have solid experience in C, C++, Python, 
                            MATLAB, and Simulink, and I am comfortable working within rigorous development processes, including 
                            requirement analysis, validation, and verification workflows.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am currently transitioning from safety-critical embedded systems to web and desktop application development, 
                            using my background in structured, high-reliability automotive software to my advantage to build modern, user-facing solutions. 
                            With solid foundations in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I approach application development with an engineering mindset 
                            that values clean architecture, maintainability, scalability, and thoughtful design. My goal is to create robust, well-structured 
                            software that combines technical depth with practical usability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I see software development as a continuous learning process. With my background, I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to new 
                            technologies, frameworks, and paradigms, while always grounding my work in engineering fundamentals.
                        </p>
