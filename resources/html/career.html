                    During my role as a Software Engineer, I was primarily responsible 
                    for the development of a trailer reverse parking assistance system

                    included not only developing the software component but also 
                    designing and implementing the control function involving complex 
                    vehicle system dynamics of both the tow vehicle and the trailer. 
                    Additionally, I actively participated in vehicle testing to identify 
                    and resolve unintended behaviors caused by the software.

                    As a research student in a government-funded microcar design project,
                    I contributed to multiple technical workstreams. I was responsible 
                    for developing vehicle dynamics simulation models in the 
                    MATLAB/Simulink environment. Additionally, I supported the 
                    development of mechanical models for Computer-Aided Engineering 
                    (CAE) analyses. During this period, I also authored and co-authored 
                    several academic publications related to our work, which are
