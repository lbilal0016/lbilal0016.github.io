                <h3>Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    I completed my mechanical engineering education with a focus on 
                    automotive engineering. Throughout my studies, I developed a strong 
                    interest in electronic control systems and programming. While working 
                    with commercial Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) tools, I began to 
                    realize that my true interest was not only in using existing software, 
                    but in building my own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, <i>developing a program to solve a simple problem was more 
                    valuable than using a commercial software to solve a complex one.</i> This 
                    realization marked a turning point in my career path and laid the 
                    foundation for my transition into software development, grounded in 
                    an engineering mindset and analytical problem-solving approach.

                <h3>Master in Mechatronics Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    During my Master’s studies in Mechatronics Engineering, I was 
                    already working as an automotive software developer. As a result, 
                    my academic direction was closely aligned with my professional 
                    experience in automotive software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I leveraged my Master’s program to deepen my expertise in software 
                    engineering, expanding my programming skill set with languages such 
                    as C++, Python, and Java. Consequently, my graduate studies became 
                    strongly centered on software design and development for automotive 
                    systems.
